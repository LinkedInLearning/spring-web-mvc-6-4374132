![Spring Web MVC 6][lil-thumbnail-url] 

Spring is one of the most popular frameworks to build applications, catering to a varied number of requirements such as web services, web applications, microservices, and more.Spring MVC helps developers build modular web applications in Java or Kotlin with a clean separation of business and presentation logic and works with a variety of UI technologies, making it easy to plug in any UI framework. In this course, instructor Ketkee Aryamane guides you through the fundamental aspects of Spring MVC, taking a deep dive into the framework that helps build robust web applications and integrates well with a variety of UI frameworks such as React and Angular. It provides foundational modular components that allows developers to focus on the business logic rather than the administrative tasks in application development.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
